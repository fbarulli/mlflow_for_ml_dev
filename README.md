# MLflow for Machine Learning Development

This repository is part of the playlist on Youtube named: MLflow for Machine Learning Development with Databricks (yet to be created)

# Notebooks 

# Package: `mlflow_for_ml_dev`

To run the notebooks is important to create the virtual environment with the required libraries, such a jupyter an the respective kernel. In addition, you need packages such as `sklearn`, `mlflow` and `pandas`


# How to use with Poetry.

* Installing poetry

        * Git Bash

            `source .venv/Scripts/activate`

# How to use without Poetry.

* Create Virtual Environment. 

    `python -m venv .venv`

* Activate the environment

    Depending on the terminal you are using:

    * Command Prompt (cmd):

        `.venv\Scripts\activate`

        `source .venv/Scripts/activate`
        
* Install requirements.

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
